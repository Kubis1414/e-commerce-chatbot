        Create a prompt that generates a list of search queries based on customer inquiries. 
        Use the chat history and context to ensure all technical details and product names are retained. 
        The output should be in Czech and formatted as a JSON object containing only the search queries list.
        These search queries should be suitable for use as lookup queries in a vector database.
        You can also set hard filters for prices which should be used, when a customer mentions price.

            Interpret the customer inquiry to determine the products or components for which complete information is needed.
            Ensure all search queries are written in Czech.
